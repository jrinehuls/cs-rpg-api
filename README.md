## Note:

<p>&emsp;The Above Udemy course is quick (about 5 hours), so the instructor's code isn't exactly
the cleanest in this example. As mentioned in the purpose section, this is fine for me for
now since the purpose is to learn ASP.NET Core Web API. I will use what I've learned in that course
and apply my coding standards to those future projects.</p>
